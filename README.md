## What is API Clinic ?
API Clinic is a web service which can run rest api functional testing and performance/load testing.
The people who use API Clinic can easily create/update/delete rest api test case in the test plan page, run functional and performance testing, check test result in the test execution page. For every test case, we provided some basic attributes, like feature, level, status, you can also add your new test case attribute as your requirments.

## Why API Clinic ?
No matter how complicated your rest api test case is, The rest api testing only include three steps: 
1. Send Request
2. Get Response
3. Compare with response data and expected data

I saw most of people use POSTMAN or other tools, even write code with java or python to run rest api testing, I think that is not a good solution to do rest api testing. So I decided to create a new way to resolve this kind of works. The purpose's of creating API Clinic is that I hope people can cover all of the rest api testing requirments. Let users can have more time focus on the test case and test scenario design, but not the test case management, test run strategy or how to show your test result to other people.
